I am trying to get labels to not wrap in Bootstrap3 but can't seem to get it to work.

I tried placing 'word-wrap: break-word' even on the label but that doesn't seem to break the label's sentence either.

I did see in the documentation to 'Wrap labels and controls in .form-group for optimum spacing.' but I cannot use 'form-group' i think if I want to use bootstrap divs to control grid/form layout of the labels/answers separately (the labels/inputs are more mobile friendy and expand to 100% of the screener when on xs screens, but on sm+ screen the labels show up left of the input to save screen space).

Here is an example... Expand the jsfiddle's right side frame very big and then you see the form labels get placed on the left with right text-alignment and the issue occuring then.
